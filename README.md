# Conversion
program that converts values of measurement.

The program takes in user input of a certain measurement unit then converts into another unit. As of right now, you cannot convert volume or area. These will be added later. Later, I will allow the user to input metric units and display the result in imperial/US. I also created a new temperature scale but this is just for fun and not meant to be taken seriously. The rationale behind this temperature scale is that humans perceive temperature more sensetivley when it is around 65F. So, 50 B degrees is equal to 65F. The further away from 50 the temperature is, the larger the difference between a degree is. For instance, 55 B degrees is equal to 65.35F. Meanwhile, 100B = 100F and 105B = 107.35F.
