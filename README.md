# Conversion
program that converts values of measurement.

The program takes in user input of a certain measurement unit then converts into another unit. Later, I will allow the user to input metric units and display the result in imperial/US. Additionally, I plan to add conversions for different number bases (decimal, binary, hexadecmial). I also created a new temperature scale but this is just for fun and not meant to be taken seriously. The rationale behind this temperature scale is that humans perceive temperature more sensetivley when it is around 65F. So, 50 B degrees is equal to 65F. The further away from 50 the temperature is, the larger the difference between a degree is. For instance, 55 B degrees is equal to 65.35F. Meanwhile, 100B = 100F and 105B = 107.35F.
The program was written in Java and requires the Java swing library to run the GUI.
