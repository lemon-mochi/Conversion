# Conversion
program that converts values of measurement.

The program takes in user input of a certain measurement unit then converts into another unit. As of right now, you cannot convert volume or area. These will be added later. Later, I will allow the user to input metric units and display the result in imperial/US. I also created a new temperature scale but this is just for fun and not meant to be taken seriously.
